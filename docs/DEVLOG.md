### 2026-03-10 — [D09] Candidate Portal — complete first draft

**Files created:**
- `docs/modules/CANDIDATE-PORTAL.md` — 16 sections (530+ lines): magic link authentication (stateless signed JWT with 3 scopes: status/schedule/offer), career page with org branding + system defaults, Typesense-powered public job search with scoped API keys, application form with resume upload + candidate dedup + GDPR consent, status tracker with adaptive polling (30s→60s backoff), interview self-scheduling UI (TimeSlotPicker, Nylas free/busy, 30-min slots), candidate email delivery (5 templates with scoped magic links), rate limiting (7 endpoint-specific limits), GDPR erasure with 48-hour cooling period, 12 API endpoints, 3 Inngest functions.

**Files updated:**
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D09 status: `⬜ Not Started` → `✅ Complete (Review)`.
- `docs/GAPS.md` — G-013 resolved (rate limiting). G-020 resolved (branding defaults). G-023 resolved (self-scheduling UI). G-026 resolved (candidate email delivery). G-029 resolved (Typesense scoped keys). G-030 resolved (polling strategy).

**Key decisions:**
- Magic links use separate JWT secret from Supabase Auth — candidates never get Supabase user accounts. Stateless verification per request.
- Token scopes: `status` (30d), `schedule` (7d), `offer` (30d). Scope limits what the token can access.
- Branding defaults: system foreground color, Inter font, default logo. `resolveTheme()` merges org config with defaults.
- Typesense scoped API keys: 90-day expiry, daily Inngest cron for rotation, stored in `organizations.metadata`.
- Polling: adaptive 30s→60s (exponential backoff on no change, reset on change). No WebSocket for candidates.
- Application submit rate: 5 per hour per IP+email. Job listing: 60/min per IP. Search: 120/min per IP.
- GDPR erasure: 48-hour cooling period via Inngest delayed event. Candidate can cancel during window.
- Self-scheduling: Growth+ plans only. First-come-first-served slot conflicts with auto-refresh.

**Post-build audit:** 7/7 categories PASS. 6 gaps resolved (G-013, G-020, G-023, G-026, G-029, G-030).

**Contracts exported:**
- D20 (White-Label): custom domain routing, email sender identity, branding_config extension.

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: stateless magic link auth for external users, adaptive polling with backoff, branding theming with fallback defaults, Typesense scoped API key rotation, GDPR erasure with cooling period.

**Status:** Review.

**Next:** Phase 1 complete. Phase 2 starts with D13 (GDPR & Compliance).

### 2026-03-10 — [D12] Workflow & State Machine — complete first draft

**Files created:**
- `docs/modules/WORKFLOW.md` — 15 sections (470+ lines): application status state machine (active/hired/rejected/withdrawn), stage transition validation (forward/backward/skip), `auto_actions` JSONB schema (6 action types: send_email, add_to_pool, notify_team, set_sla, webhook, auto_advance), Zod validation, auto-advance on interview completion (G-025), talent pool automation via conditional pool membership (G-018), SLA enforcement with delayed Inngest events, workflow execution engine (stage-changed + rejection handlers), bulk operations (50 limit), rejection flow with pool automation, plan gating (auto-advance Pro+, webhook Enterprise only).

**Files updated:**
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D12 status: `⬜ Not Started` → `✅ Complete (Review)`. Path corrected from `WORKFLOW-ENGINE.md` to `WORKFLOW.md`.
- `docs/GAPS.md` — G-018 resolved (talent pool auto-membership via `add_to_pool` action). G-025 resolved (auto-advance via Inngest function with loop prevention).

**Key decisions:**
- `auto_actions` is an array of typed actions (discriminated union), not a flat config object. Max 10 actions per stage. Validated at save time via Zod, not at runtime.
- Auto-advance uses `interview/scorecard-submitted` event as trigger, checks all interviews + scorecards, then moves candidate. Infinite loop prevention: auto-advance events don't trigger subsequent auto-advance actions.
- Talent pool automation lives in `auto_actions` — no separate "pool rules" table. Keeps all workflow config in one place.
- SLA timers use Inngest delayed events. No explicit cancellation — idempotent check at execution time (re-read current stage).
- Bulk operations cap at 50 per request. Sequential processing (not parallel) to maintain audit trail ordering.
- System user UUID (`00000000-...`) for auto-advance `transitioned_by` — sentinel value, not a real user.

**Post-build audit:** 7/7 categories PASS. No fixes needed.

**Contracts exported:**
- D09 (Candidate Portal): application status changes trigger notification events; candidate sees status via polling.
- D16 (Performance): bulk operations may spike DB writes; connection pooling must handle 50 sequential updates.
- D17 (Analytics): pipeline throughput metrics derive from `application_stage_history`; SLA breach counts from `notification/dispatch` events.

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: `auto_actions` JSONB schema for configurable workflow automation, auto-advance with loop prevention, SLA via delayed events (no timer table), talent pool automation as stage action.

**Status:** Review.

**Next:** D09 (Candidate Portal) — last Phase 1 doc. 6 gaps to resolve (G-013, G-020, G-023, G-026, G-029, G-030).

### 2026-03-10 — [D11] Real-Time Features — complete first draft

**Files created:**
- `docs/modules/REALTIME.md` — 13 sections (394 lines): Supabase Realtime architecture using 3 primitives (Postgres Changes, Broadcast, Presence), channel naming convention (`{scope}:{org_id}:{resource}[:{id}]`), 7 subscribed tables with event filters, notification broadcast (D08 integration), page-level + team presence, optimistic UI with dedup, connection management + reconnection, last-write-wins conflict resolution, ChannelManager cleanup utility.

**Files updated:**
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D11 status: `⬜ Not Started` → `✅ Complete (Review)`.
- `docs/GAPS.md` — G-027 resolved. G-030 added. G-018 re-tagged from "D11 (Talent Pools)" → "D12 (Workflow)". G-019 re-tagged from "D12 (Analytics)" → "D17 (Analytics)".

**Key decisions:**
- Channel naming: `{scope}:{org_id}:{resource}[:{id}]`. org_id always present for tenant isolation. Derived from JWT, never client input.
- 7 tables subscribed (applications, stage_history, interviews, scorecards, offers, notes, candidates). 30+ tables intentionally excluded — low frequency or derived from parent events.
- No `notifications` table: broadcast-only delivery aligns with D08's ephemeral notification design.
- Last-write-wins conflict resolution. No CRDTs or OT — overkill for ATS where concurrent edits on same entity are rare.
- Presence limits: 100 users/channel (Supabase limit), fallback to polling for large orgs.
- High-volume batching: `requestAnimationFrame` + 100ms accumulation window for bulk operations.

**Post-build audit:** 7/7 categories PASS. No fixes needed. No [VERIFY] markers (Supabase Realtime is core platform).

**Contracts exported:**
- D09 (Candidate Portal): candidates use polling, not Realtime (no persistent WebSocket). D09 must define polling interval.
- D16 (Performance): Realtime connection pooling targets, max 10 channels per client.

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: channel naming convention for multi-tenant Realtime, optimistic UI with Realtime dedup, presence with graceful degradation, ChannelManager for SPA route cleanup.

**Status:** Review.

**Next:** D12 (Workflow) then D09 (Candidate Portal) — completes Phase 1.

---

### 2026-03-10 — [D10] Search Architecture — complete first draft

**Files created:**
- `docs/modules/SEARCH.md` — 12 sections (495 lines): two-engine design (Typesense full-text + pgvector semantic), Typesense collection schemas (candidates + jobs), Postgres→Typesense sync pipeline via Inngest, AI matching with composite scoring (semantic + skill overlap), embedding lifecycle (generate/invalidate/re-embed on content change), differentiated AI credit weights per action, full-reindex, sync health monitoring, 6 API endpoints with Zod schemas, 4 Inngest functions, 6 UI components.

**Files updated:**
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D10 status: `⬜ Not Started` → `✅ Complete (Review)`.
- `docs/GAPS.md` — G-016 and G-017 resolved. G-028, G-029 added. V-014, V-015 added.

**Key decisions:**
- Stale embeddings: re-embed on content change (resume_text, skills, title, company). No TTL-based expiry. If no credits, keep old embedding (stale but functional).
- AI credit weights: differentiated per action — `resume_parse`=2, `candidate_match`=1, `job_description_generate`=3, `email_draft`=1, `feedback_summarize`=1. New `consume_ai_credits(p_org_id, p_amount)` SQL function.
- Composite matching score: 60% semantic (cosine) + 40% skill overlap.
- Typesense tenant isolation: `organization_id` filter applied server-side on every query.
- Typesense fallback: if down, degrade to PostgreSQL `pg_trgm`. Inngest events queue + replay.

**Post-build audit:** 7/7 categories PASS. No fixes needed. 2 strategic [VERIFY] markers (V-014, V-015).

**Contracts exported:**
- D09 (Candidate Portal): public job search via Typesense scoped API key per organization.
- D16 (Performance): Typesense search caching + pgvector query optimization targets.
- D17 (Analytics): search usage metrics (queries/day, AI match requests, credit consumption by action).
- D03 (Billing): `consume_ai_credits()` function with variable weights — adopt at code time (G-028).

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: two-engine search (full-text + vector), event-driven sync pipeline, composite scoring (semantic + structured), embedding lifecycle with credit-gated re-generation, tenant isolation at search layer.

**Status:** Review.

**Next:** D09, D11, D12 — remaining Phase 1.

### 2026-03-10 — [D08] Notification System — complete first draft

**Files created:**
- `docs/modules/NOTIFICATIONS.md` — 11 sections (417 lines): unified notification dispatch (in-app + email + webhook), event catalog (22 event types), Supabase Realtime for in-app, React Email + Resend for transactional email, Handlebars-style template variables, @mention notification via Inngest, webhook outbound with HMAC signing + health management + auto-disable, notification preferences per user per event, digest mode, 17 API endpoints with Zod schemas, 7 Inngest functions, 7 UI components.

**Files updated:**
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D08 status: `⬜ Not Started` → `✅ Complete (Review)`.
- `docs/GAPS.md` — G-014, G-015, G-021, G-024 resolved. G-026, G-027 added. V-013 added. Fixed D08/D09 mislabeling (GAPS had Notifications as D09 and Candidate Portal as D08 — corrected to match INDEX.md).
- `docs/modules/INTERVIEW-SCHEDULING.md` — Fixed D08/D09 references in "Depended on by" front matter.
- `docs/DEVLOG.md` — Fixed D07 contracts exported section (D08/D09 swap) and "Next" line.

**Key decisions:**
- No dedicated `notifications` table — in-app notifications via Supabase Realtime broadcast (ephemeral), persistent history derived from source tables (audit_logs, notes, scorecards). Avoids data duplication.
- @Mention notifications via Inngest event (not Realtime, not direct insert). Reason: mentions need email delivery for offline users; Inngest handles retries + preference routing.
- Email template syntax: Handlebars-style `{{variable.path}}` with strict allowlist from `merge_fields` column. No Liquid/custom. Consistent for future D20 i18n.
- Webhook re-enablement: manual only. Warning at 5 failures, auto-disable at 10, admin notification both times. No auto-retry — failed endpoints need human investigation.
- Self-notification suppression: users never notified of their own actions (`actor_id !== recipient_id`).
- Digest mode: daily batched email at 8 AM UTC for users who opt in. In-app stays immediate.

**Post-build audit:** 7/7 categories PASS. No fixes needed. 1 strategic [VERIFY] marker for Resend API (V-013).

**Contracts exported:**
- D09 (Candidate Portal): candidate-facing email delivery (5 event types) defined in D08 §4.3 but delivery via D09 candidate auth context.
- D11 (Real-Time): Supabase Realtime channel naming convention for org-scoped + user-filtered notification broadcast.
- D12 (Workflow): `application.stage_changed` event available for notification + webhook dispatch on stage transitions.
- D20 (i18n): template variable syntax is `{{variable.path}}` — i18n must use same syntax for translated templates.

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: preference-aware notification routing (in-app/email/both/none), webhook outbound with health tracking + auto-disable, ephemeral in-app via Realtime (no notification table), Handlebars merge fields with allowlist, digest batching via cron.

**Status:** Review.

**Next:** D10 (Search Architecture) or D09 (Candidate Portal) — per user direction.

---

### 2026-03-10 — [META] Fix D08/D09 doc number mislabeling in GAPS.md

**Files updated:**
- `docs/GAPS.md` — GAPS.md had Notifications labeled as D09 and Candidate Portal as D08, opposite to INDEX.md. Corrected: D08 = Notifications, D09 = Candidate Portal. Affected gaps: G-013, G-014, G-015, G-020, G-021, G-023, G-024.
- `docs/modules/INTERVIEW-SCHEDULING.md` — "Depended on by" front matter corrected.
- `docs/DEVLOG.md` — D07 "Contracts exported" and "Next" corrected.

---

### 2026-03-10 — [D07] Interview Scheduling & Scorecards — complete first draft

**Files created:**
- `docs/modules/INTERVIEW-SCHEDULING.md` — 11 sections (461 lines): 5-state interview machine (scheduled → confirmed → completed, plus cancelled/no_show), manual + panel + self-scheduling, Nylas calendar two-way sync, scorecard templates with snapshot-on-assign versioning, blind review (auto-reveal after own submission), AI scorecard summarization (Pro+), weighted score aggregation, feedback deadline reminders, 18 API endpoints with Zod schemas, 7 Inngest functions, 8 UI components.

**Files updated:**
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D07 status: `⬜ Not Started` → `✅ Complete (Review)`.
- `docs/GAPS.md` — G-011 and G-012 resolved. G-023, G-024, G-025 added. V-011, V-012 added.

**Key decisions:**
- Blind review reveal: auto-reveal after own submission (no manual button, no wait-for-all). Prevents bias while enabling collaboration. RLS-enforced at DB.
- Template versioning: snapshot-on-assign via D01 append-only design. No versioning table. Old attributes soft-deleted, new ones created. Existing submissions always reference valid (soft-deleted) attributes.
- Panel interviews: modeled as N individual `interviews` rows with matching `scheduled_at` + `interview_type = 'panel'`. No separate panel table.
- Self-scheduling: candidate selects from Nylas free/busy slots, interview created as `confirmed` (skips `scheduled`). 3 reschedule limit, 7-day link expiry.
- Feedback deadlines: advisory, not hard-enforced. Late submissions always accepted. Rationale: better late feedback than none.
- Candidate signs after expiry of self-scheduling link: slot no longer available, must request new link.

**Post-build audit:** 7/7 categories PASS. No fixes needed. 2 strategic [VERIFY] markers for Nylas API (V-011, V-012).

**Contracts exported:**
- D09 (Candidate Portal): self-scheduling UI — time slot picker, confirmation flow, 3-reschedule limit, link expiry display.
- D08 (Notifications): 4 interview email triggers — scheduled, cancelled, feedback reminder, scorecard submitted.
- D12 (Workflow): optional auto-advance when all interviews completed + all scorecards submitted.
- D17 (Analytics): scorecard aggregation data (weighted scores, recommendation distribution, time-to-feedback).
- D10 (Search & AI): AI scorecard summarization consumes 1 credit with `action = 'feedback_summarize'`.

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: blind review with auto-reveal RLS, snapshot-on-assign versioning (no version table), panel-as-individual-rows modeling, self-scheduling with calendar free/busy, weighted multi-criteria scoring aggregation.

**Status:** Review.

**Next:** D08 (Notification System) — per production order.

### 2026-03-10 — [D06] Offer Management — complete first draft

**Files created:**
- `docs/modules/OFFERS.md` — 11 sections (302 lines): 8-state machine (draft → pending_approval → approved → sent → signed/declined/expired/withdrawn), sequential approval chain with auto-skip for departed approvers, Dropbox Sign e-sign integration with Inngest retry + manual PDF fallback, offer templates with compensation editor, hourly expiry cron, 14 API endpoints with Zod schemas, 6 Inngest functions, 7 UI components.

**Files updated:**
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D06 status: `⬜ Not Started` → `✅ Complete (Review)`. Path corrected from `OFFER-WORKFLOW.md` to `OFFERS.md`.
- `docs/GAPS.md` — G-010 and G-022 resolved.

**Key decisions:**
- Approver removed mid-chain → auto-skip (not block). Logged in audit. Rationale: blocking offers on departed employees is worse than auto-advancing.
- E-sign unavailability → Inngest retries, offer stays `approved` (not stuck in `sent`). Manual PDF fallback available.
- Candidate signs after expiry → accept signature. `signed` trumps `expired`. Expiry cron only targets `status = 'sent'`.
- Two offers per application allowed but UI warns. Only one can be in `sent`/`signed` state.
- Rejection resets entire chain to `draft` — recruiter edits and resubmits.

**Post-build audit:** 7/7 categories PASS. No fixes needed. 2 strategic [VERIFY] markers for Dropbox Sign API (expected).

**Contracts exported:**
- D08 (Candidate Portal): offer acceptance is via Dropbox Sign signing link, not ATS UI. Candidate never sees compensation in ATS.
- D09 (Communications): 4 email triggers — approval request, offer sent to candidate, signed notification, declined notification.
- D07 (Interviews): no direct dependency, but interviews must be `completed` before offer stage (pipeline stage ordering).
- D19 (Migration): offer import format matches `OfferCompensation` interface + 8 status values.

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: multi-step approval chain with auto-skip, e-sign integration with retry + manual fallback, state machine with terminal states, cron-based expiry detection.

**Status:** Review.

**Next:** D07 (Interview & Scorecard Module).

---

### 2026-03-10 — [D03] Billing & Subscription Architecture — complete first draft

**Files created:**
- `docs/modules/BILLING.md` — 13 sections (500 lines): 4 plan tiers with 16-feature matrix, Stripe Checkout + Customer Portal integration, subscription lifecycle (trialing → active → canceling → canceled, plus past_due → unpaid dunning path), seat-based pricing with overage proration, AI credit metering with atomic consumption + monthly overage reporting, 6 Inngest functions for webhook processing, downgrade graceful degradation rules, 5 billing API endpoints with Zod schemas.

**Files updated:**
- `docs/DATABASE-SCHEMA.md` — Added `webhook_outbound` and `sso_saml` to `FeatureFlags` interface (audit fix F2: D03 feature matrix referenced flags not in D01).
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D03 status: `⬜ Not Started` → `✅ Complete (Review)`.

**Key decisions:**
- Stripe is source of truth for subscriptions/invoices. ATS stores minimal billing state (`plan`, `stripe_customer_id`, `ai_credits_*` on organizations table).
- No separate billing/subscription tables — Stripe API queried on demand for portal/invoice views.
- Seat sync via Stripe API lookup (not a stored `stripe_subscription_item_id` column) to avoid schema bloat.
- Plan config in code (`lib/billing/plans.ts`) not database — changes deploy, not migrate.
- Starter plan is free, no Stripe Customer required until upgrade.
- Enterprise plan is custom pricing, manual Stripe Dashboard setup.

**Post-build audit:** 8 PASS, 3 FAIL, 2 WARNINGS — all fixes applied:
- F1: Removed non-existent `stripe_subscription_item_id` column reference → Stripe API lookup
- F2: Added `webhook_outbound` and `sso_saml` to D01 FeatureFlags interface
- F3: Added [VERIFY] markers to Stripe API calls per §18

**Status:** Review.

**Contracts exported:**
- D06-D12: `hasFeature(org, flag)` gate before any plan-gated operation
- D06 (Offers): offer creation gated by active subscription (not starter unless free trial)
- D07 (Interviews): AI scorecard summarization gated by `ai_matching` feature flag
- D08 (Candidate Portal): no billing-gated features on candidate-facing pages
- D09 (Communications): `webhook_outbound` flag gates outbound webhook delivery; email templates available on all plans
- D10 (Search & AI): `ai_matching` + `ai_resume_parsing` flags gate AI operations; `consumeAiCredits()` called before every AI action; 402 on exhaustion
- D11 (Talent Pools): `nurture_sequences` flag gates CRM automation features
- D12 (Analytics): `advanced_analytics` flag gates advanced reports; basic metrics on all plans
- D13 (Observability): billing metrics from `ai_usage_logs` + `organizations.plan`; Stripe webhook success rate
- D19 (Migration): new organizations default to `starter` plan; `ai_credits_limit = 0` (plan setup sets real value)

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: plan-tier feature matrix, Stripe-as-truth architecture, seat-based pricing with overage, AI credit metering, dunning flow, downgrade graceful degradation.

**Next:** D04 remaining STACK ADRs (non-blocking) or begin Batch 2 feature modules (D06-D12).

### 2026-03-10 — [D02] API Specification — complete first draft

**Files created:**
- `docs/API-SPECIFICATION.md` — 13 sections (486 lines): auth model (JWT + API key), RBAC enforcement (`can(role, permission)` helper + RLS), URL conventions (`/api/v1/`, kebab-case plural), cursor pagination (base64-encoded `{sort_value, id}`, 25 default / 100 max), RFC 9457 error responses, rate limiting (4 plan tiers via @upstash/ratelimit), idempotency (Redis-backed, 24h TTL), webhook outbound (HMAC-SHA256 signing, Inngest retry with exponential backoff, auto-disable after 10 failures), webhook inbound (Merge.dev, Nylas, Stripe, Dropbox Sign), Zod→OpenAPI 3.1 via @asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi.
- `docs/api/ENDPOINTS.md` — 50+ endpoints across 4 categories: Core CRUD (auth, organizations, jobs, candidates, applications, pipeline, notes, files), Module-Specific (interviews, scorecards, offers, talent pools, skills, custom fields), Search & AI (Typesense search, AI matching), Settings & Admin (webhooks, API keys, notification preferences, audit logs, DEI reports).

**Files updated:**
- `docs/AI-RULES.md` — Rule 33: updated RFC 7807 reference to RFC 9457 (Problem Details) for consistency with D02.
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D02 status: `⬜ Not Started` → `✅ Complete (Review)`.

**Key decisions:**
- Server Actions for UI mutations (form submissions, state changes), Route Handlers for external/M2M integrations
- API keys stored as SHA-256 hash in `api_keys` table, raw key shown once at creation
- Rate limit tiers match D01 plan_tier CHECK constraint: starter (500/min), growth (2,000/min), pro (5,000/min), enterprise (10,000/min)
- Webhook signing uses `secret` column (not `signing_secret`) — matches D01 DDL
- Cursor pagination chosen over offset for stable performance on large datasets
- Idempotency keys required for all POST mutations, optional for PUT/PATCH

**Post-build audit:** 8 PASS, 5 FAIL, 4 WARNINGS — all fixes applied:
- F2: Removed non-existent `api_keys.is_active` (RLS handles via `deleted_at`)
- F3: Fixed `api_keys.scopes` → `permissions`, `rate_limit_tier` → derived from org plan
- F4: Corrected plan tier values (free/starter/professional/enterprise → starter/growth/pro/enterprise) to match D01 DDL CHECK
- F5: Updated AI-RULES.md rule 33 from RFC 7807 to RFC 9457
- W3: Added missing ADR-006/007/008 to front matter
- W4: Standardized `signing_secret` → `secret` throughout

**Contracts exported:**
- D06-D12: all module endpoints follow `/api/v1/{resource}` pattern, cursor pagination, RFC 9457 errors
- D06 (Offers): `POST /api/v1/offers` + approval chain endpoints; idempotency key required
- D07 (Interviews): `POST /api/v1/interviews`, `POST /api/v1/scorecard-submissions`; blind review enforced at API layer
- D08 (Candidate Portal): public endpoints at `/api/v1/careers/` — no JWT, rate limited
- D09 (Communications): webhook outbound delivery via `POST /api/v1/webhook-endpoints`; HMAC-SHA256 signing with `secret` column
- D10 (Search & AI): `GET /api/v1/search` delegates to Typesense; `POST /api/v1/ai/match` consumes credits
- D03 (Billing): rate limit tiers (starter 500/min → enterprise 10,000/min); Stripe webhook at `/api/webhooks/stripe`
- D13 (Observability): all endpoints emit structured logs; rate limit headers in every response
- D19 (Migration): API versioning via URL prefix `/api/v1/`; no breaking changes within version

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: dual API layer (Server Actions + Route Handlers), cursor pagination, RFC 9457 errors, rate limiting by plan tier, idempotency keys, webhook HMAC signing, Zod→OpenAPI generation.

**Status:** Review.

**Next:** D03 (Billing & Subscription Architecture).

### 2026-03-10 — [D05] Design System — complete first draft

**File created:**
- `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` — 11 sections covering: design principles (7), color system (brand palette + semantic status + dark mode in HSL/CSS variables), typography (Inter + Geist Mono, 8-point type scale with 14px dashboard base), spacing scale, layout grid (sidebar + topnav + content), responsive breakpoints (5 tiers, desktop-first), shadcn/ui component customizations (16 base components + 10 ATS-specific), WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility (contrast ratios verified, keyboard nav, screen reader, reduced motion), animation tokens (4 durations, 8 interaction patterns using Motion/Framer Motion v11+), Lucide React iconography, career page tenant theming (maps to D01 branding_config), component file organization.

**Competitive research conducted:** Analyzed Ashby (analytics-first design, clean aesthetic), Greenhouse (brand guidelines, left sidebar redesign, stage colors), Lever (UI praise), shadcn/ui theming conventions, WCAG 2.1 AA requirements, 2025-2026 SaaS design trends.

**Key decisions:**
- 14px body base for dashboard (data-dense), 16px for candidate portal
- Inter as primary font (highest x-height, used by Linear/Vercel)
- Warm white background (#FEFDFB) not pure white (reduces eye strain)
- Primary blue (#145FD9) at 5.3:1 contrast ratio (safely above 4.5:1 WCAG AA)
- Dark mode from day one via next-themes cookie strategy
- Motion library for drag-and-drop (kanban), CSS transitions for simple states
- Tenant branding limited to career pages only (internal UI stays consistent)

**Post-build audit:** 7 FAILs identified, all resolved (2 were false positives from wrong CLAUDE.md scope). Fixes: added D01 dependency, fixed STACK-1 mislabel, bumped primary contrast, pinned library versions, fixed spring syntax.

**Contracts exported:**
- D06-D12: all UI uses shadcn/ui components with HSL color tokens; no custom color values
- D06 (Offers): offer status badges use semantic status colors (success/warning/destructive)
- D07 (Interviews): `KanbanBoard` + `KanbanCard` components for pipeline view; `ScoreRubric` for scorecard UI; `InterviewScheduler` for calendar
- D08 (Candidate Portal): `branding_config` drives career page theming (maps to D01); 16px body text; accessible contrast
- D09 (Communications): `TimelineActivity` component for candidate activity feed; toast notifications via sonner
- D10 (Search & AI): `FilterBar` component for faceted search UI
- D11 (Talent Pools): `CandidateDrawer` for quick-view; `StageIndicator` for pipeline position
- D12 (Analytics): `MetricCard` for dashboard KPIs; chart colors from semantic palette
- D13 (Observability): dark mode via `next-themes` cookie strategy; `OrgSwitcher` component

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: HSL token system, warm-white backgrounds, data-dense 14px dashboard, dark mode from day one, shadcn/ui customization approach, ATS-specific component library.

**Status:** Review.

**Next:** D02 (API Specification).

### 2026-03-10 — [D01] Post-build audit fixes applied (6/6)

**Files updated:**
- `docs/schema/00-functions.md` — Fix 1: erase_candidate() expanded with 4 missing soft-delete steps (scorecard_ratings, interviews, application_stage_history, candidate_dei_data). Fix 5: Added `pg_trgm` extension.
- `docs/ADRs/006-soft-delete-policy.md` — Fix 2: Added `candidate_encryption_keys` to append-only exceptions list.
- `docs/DATABASE-SCHEMA.md` — Fix 3: Renamed `RequiredActions`/`AutoTriggers` interfaces to `AutoActions` matching DDL column `auto_actions`. Fix 6: Removed orphaned `JobLocation`/`SalaryRange`/`ExternalIds` interfaces (DDL uses scalar columns), replaced with `JobMetadata` for the actual `metadata JSONB` column. Updated extensions list and soft-delete exceptions.
- `docs/ADRs/009-file-storage-pattern.md` — Fix 4: Changed `uploaded_by` FK from `user_profiles(id)` to `auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`.

**Status:** All 6 audit FAIL items resolved. D01 ready for Review status.

**39 tables total across 8 clusters.** All S3 errata corrected (HNSW not IVFFlat, deleted_at on all tables, full RLS on all tables, proxy.ts not middleware.ts references removed).

**New tables not in S3 (26):** application_stage_history, talent_pools, talent_pool_members, candidate_sources, rejection_reasons, skills, candidate_skills, job_required_skills, interviews, scorecard_templates, scorecard_categories, scorecard_attributes, scorecard_submissions, scorecard_ratings, offer_templates, offers, offer_approvals, email_templates, notification_preferences, files, custom_field_definitions, custom_field_values, audit_logs, ai_usage_logs, api_keys, webhook_endpoints, candidate_dei_data, candidate_encryption_keys, gdpr_erasure_log.

**Contracts exported (master list — all downstream docs depend on D01):**
- **Tables (39):** exact names, column types, constraints. All module specs MUST use these names verbatim.
- **CHECK constraints:** `organizations.plan` (starter/growth/pro/enterprise), `organization_members.role` (owner/admin/recruiter/hiring_manager/interviewer), `job_openings.status` (draft/open/paused/closed/archived), `applications.status` (active/hired/rejected/withdrawn), `interviews.status` (scheduled/confirmed/completed/cancelled/no_show), `offers.status` (8 states: draft→withdrawn), `scorecard_submissions.overall_recommendation` (strong_no/no/yes/strong_yes)
- **JSONB interfaces (11):** BrandingConfig, FeatureFlags, UserPreferences, CustomPermissions, JobMetadata, CandidateLocation, ResumeParsed, SourceDetails, AutoActions, OfferCompensation, DeiData — ground-truth types for all modules
- **RLS helpers:** `current_user_org_id()`, `is_org_member()`, `has_org_role()` — every module's RLS policies use these
- **Functions:** `match_candidates_for_job()` → D10; `erase_candidate()` → D19/GDPR; `custom_access_token_hook()` → JWT claims for auth
- **Patterns:** soft delete (`deleted_at IS NULL` in all SELECTs), audit trigger on every table, HNSW vector indexes (m=16, ef_construction=64)
- **Realtime channels:** `org:{id}:applications`, `org:{id}:notes`, `org:{id}:interviews`, `org:{id}:scorecard_submissions`, `org:{id}:offers`, `org:{id}:notification_preferences`
- **D06 (Offers):** `offers.status` 8-state machine, `offer_approvals.sequence_order`, `OfferCompensation` interface, `offers.esign_provider` CHECK
- **D07 (Interviews):** `interviews.*`, `scorecard_templates/categories/attributes/submissions/ratings.*`, blind review RLS on scorecard_submissions
- **D08 (Candidate Portal):** `candidates.*`, `applications.*`, `job_openings.*` (public-facing subset)
- **D09 (Communications):** `notes.*` (polymorphic via entity_type/entity_id), `email_templates.*`, `files.*` (ADR-009), `notification_preferences.*`, `webhook_endpoints.*`
- **D10 (Search & AI):** `candidate_embedding`/`job_embedding` vector(1536), `match_candidates_for_job()`, `ai_usage_logs.*`
- **D11 (Talent Pools):** `talent_pools.*`, `talent_pool_members.*`, `candidate_sources.*`
- **D12 (Analytics):** `candidate_dei_data.*` (restricted RLS), `audit_logs.*` (partitioned), `custom_field_definitions/values.*`

**[PLAYBOOK]** Extractable patterns: multi-tenant RLS with JWT claims hook, soft-delete-everywhere policy, polymorphic entity pattern, HNSW vector indexes for AI matching, crypto-shredding for GDPR, audit trigger architecture.

**Status:** Draft. Pending post-build audit (AI-RULES §13) before marking as Review.

**Next:** Run post-build audit, fix any issues, then mark D01 as Review.

### 2026-03-10 — [META] AI-RULES expanded: audit protocol, security gates, schema evolution, and 8 new best-practice sections

**Files updated:**
- `docs/AI-RULES.md` — Added §13-§20 (rules 59-87):
  - §13 Post-Build Audit Protocol (rules 59-63): mandatory audit triggers, 7-category checklist (A1-A7), structured report format, dependency-ordered fixes
  - §14 Downstream Impact Protocol (rules 64-66): mandatory impact check when any document changes, special rules for D01 schema changes
  - §15 Breaking Change Protocol (rules 67-68): definition, requirements, mandatory post-fix audit
  - §16 Security Review Gates (rules 69-71): RLS completeness, auth flow, data exposure checklists
  - §17 Schema Evolution Rules (rules 72-76): migration strategy, idempotency, 2-step deprecation
  - §18 Third-Party Integration Verification (rules 77-80): [VERIFY] lifecycle, version-pinned claims
  - §19 Performance and Scalability Considerations (rules 81-84): row volume estimates, query budgets, partitioning
  - §20 Dependency and Ordering Discipline (rules 85-87): upstream-first fix ordering, priority/blast-radius classification

**Why:** The manual audit before D01 revealed the need for a repeatable, documented audit process. Additionally, security review gates, schema evolution rules, and performance considerations were missing best practices that would cause rework if not established now.

**Total rules:** 87 (up from 58).

**Next:** D01 (Complete Database Schema).

### 2026-03-10 — [D04] ADR-005→010 — All blocking decisions resolved, D01 fully unblocked

**Files created:**
- `docs/ADRs/005-multi-org-switching.md` — AC-5 resolved: `last_active_org_id` + JWT refresh. No re-auth.
- `docs/ADRs/006-soft-delete-policy.md` — AC-4 resolved: all tables get `deleted_at`. Exception: `audit_logs` (append-only).
- `docs/ADRs/007-audit-log-architecture.md` — Trigger-based, append-only, partitioned by month. Generic `audit_trigger_func()` on every table.
- `docs/ADRs/008-enum-strategy.md` — CHECK for system values, lookup tables for tenant-customizable, JSONB for config. No PG ENUMs.
- `docs/ADRs/009-file-storage-pattern.md` — Supabase Storage + centralized `files` metadata table. Virus scan gate via Inngest.
- `docs/ADRs/010-gdpr-erasure-crypto-shredding.md` — Per-candidate encryption keys for audit log crypto-shredding + selective anonymization.

**Files updated:**
- `docs/PLAN.md` — Decisions Registry: AC-4, AC-5 resolved. Added SCHEMA-1→5 entries.
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D01 notes updated: "Fully unblocked — all 10 prerequisite ADRs resolved."

**Competitive research conducted:** Analyzed Ashby, Lever, Greenhouse, Teamtailor, Workable. Identified 5 missing table clusters for D01: structured scorecards, CRM/talent pools, custom fields, skills taxonomy, DEI data isolation.

**Why:** Final pre-D01 check. Every implicit decision that would cause rework during schema writing is now an explicit, recorded ADR.

**All open decisions: ZERO.** AC-1→6 resolved. All schema strategy decisions resolved. D01 can proceed with full confidence.

**Next:** Write D01 (Complete Database Schema) — ~30+ tables including the 5 new table clusters identified from competitive analysis.

---

### 2026-03-10 — [D04] ADR-004 Testing Strategy — what's built when

**Files created:**
- `docs/ADRs/004-testing-strategy.md` — 3-tier testing strategy: Day 1 (unit, RLS, API, jobs, E2E), per-feature (smoke, contract, a11y, search relevance), pre-launch (perf, load, security, DR). 5 "never retrofit" items identified.

**Files updated:**
- `docs/PLAN.md` — Decisions Registry: added TEST-1 entry

**Why:** Testing strategy must be decided before D01 because golden tenant fixtures are defined alongside the schema, and RLS integration tests are mandatory from the first table.

**Next:** D01 (Complete Database Schema) with golden tenant fixtures defined inline.

---

### 2026-03-10 — [D04] ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003 written — D01 unblocked

**Files created:**
- `docs/ADRs/001-supabase-client-only.md` — AC-1 resolved: Supabase client everywhere, no Prisma. RLS enforced on every query including background jobs.
- `docs/ADRs/002-nextjs-16-proxy-middleware.md` — AC-2 + AC-3 resolved: Next.js 16 with `proxy.ts`. CLAUDE.md is authority, S3 references are errata.
- `docs/ADRs/003-hnsw-vector-indexes.md` — AC-6 resolved: HNSW indexes (not IVFFlat). Works from row 0, no rebuild needed.

**Files updated:**
- `docs/PLAN.md` — Decisions Registry: AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-6 status changed from `Open` to `Resolved → ADR-NNN`
- `docs/INDEX.md` — D01 status: `🔴 Blocked` → `⬜ Not Started` (unblocked). D04 status: `⬜ Not Started` → `🟡 In Progress`

**Also:**
- `.gitignore` created
- Git repository initialized

**Why:** D01 (Complete Database Schema) was blocked by 3 open architecture decisions. These ADRs resolve the blockers so D01 can proceed.

**Next:** Write D01 (Complete Database Schema) — the critical path item that unblocks 12 downstream documents.

---

### 2026-03-10 — [META] Pre-commit protocol and governance rules established

**Files updated:**
- `CLAUDE.md` (ATS) — Added: task-based reading tiers (5 task types), S3 errata table (6 known errors), pre-commit protocol (4 commit types with checklists), commit message convention with scopes
- `CLAUDE.md` (Playbook) — Added: pre-commit protocol (3 commit types), commit message convention for playbook scopes
- `docs/PLAN.md` — Added: Decisions Registry (6 open + 6 decided), parallel work coordination rule
- `docs/AI-RULES.md` — Added: §11 Document Front Matter standard (rules 51-53), §12 Definition of Done by document type (rules 54-58)
- `SaaS-Playbook/JOURNEY-LOG.md` — Added: Battle-Test Log section

**Why:** Seven governance gaps closed: decision re-opening, premature doc completion, S3 error propagation, token waste, downstream staleness, parallel work conflicts, untested prompt shipping.

**Key rule:** Parallel docs (D01, D04, D05) must NOT assume `Open` decisions — resolve as ADRs first.

**Next:** Begin D01, but first resolve AC-1 and AC-2 as standalone ADRs since D01 depends on both.

---

### 2026-03-10 — [META] Session handoff protocol created

**Files created:**
- `CLAUDE.md` (ATS root) — 3-step handoff: read state → confirm context → follow rules
- `CLAUDE.md` (SaaS-Playbook root) — Same pattern, product-specific rules

**Why:** Prevent drift and hallucination when moving between Claude Code sessions.

---

### 2026-03-10 — [PLAYBOOK] SaaS Accelerator Playbook elevated to marketable product

**New files created in `/Users/senthilbabu/Downloads/SaaS-Playbook/product/`:**
- `PRODUCT-SPEC.md` — Full product specification: what customers buy, value chain, pricing tiers (Starter $49 / Professional $149 / Team $299 / Enterprise $499+), technical architecture (static site + Stripe), content pipeline, legal/IP
- `WIZARD-IA.md` — Complete wizard: 9 steps, 51 questions, branching logic, cross-step validation, pre-population rules by product category, placeholder mapping for every question
- `OUTPUT-MAP.md` — Template engine spec: 35 placeholder resolutions, conditional file inclusion rules, section-level toggles, output package structure, zero-hallucination validation pass

**Key product decision:** The product is a deterministic template engine, NOT an AI wrapper. No LLM runs in our product. Wizard collects context → placeholders filled via string substitution → customized prompts delivered. The AI runs downstream in the customer's Claude Code session. This gives us: zero hallucination risk, predictable output, platform agnosticism.

**Two parallel tracks confirmed:**
1. ATS (product being built) — battle-tests the prompts
2. SaaS Accelerator Playbook (product being sold) — packages the prompts

---

### 2026-03-10 — [PLAYBOOK] SaaS Accelerator Playbook created

**Location:** `/Users/senthilbabu/Downloads/SaaS-Playbook/` (separate from ATS repo)

**Purpose:** Generic, product-agnostic playbook of executable Claude Code prompts for building any SaaS product. Lessons from the ATS build feed into this playbook (abstracted, product details stripped).

**Created:**
- 4 core files: README, PRINCIPLES (15 principles seeded), JOURNEY-LOG, GLOSSARY
- 7 phase skeletons (00-validate through 06-scale) with entry/exit criteria
- 7 deep prompts for Phase 01-Architect (multi-tenancy, auth, schema, API, background-jobs, documentation-system, ADR generator, tech-stack-evaluator)
- 9 role entry-points (architect, backend, frontend, security, SDET, devops, PM, marketing, sales)
- 5 cross-cutting concerns (multi-tenancy, billing, data-isolation, GDPR, observability)
- 4 output templates (ADR, module spec, API endpoint, runbook)

**Bridge mechanism:** ATS DEVLOG entries tagged `[PLAYBOOK]` get abstracted and added to `SaaS-Playbook/JOURNEY-LOG.md`. Lessons flow one-way: ATS → Playbook.

**Next:** When we write ATS docs (D01, D02, etc.), we'll simultaneously use and refine the corresponding playbook prompts. The prompts become battle-tested.

### 2026-03-10 — [META] Documentation tracking system created

**Documents created:**
- `docs/INDEX.md` — Master documentation registry with 21 planned documents across 4 phases
- `docs/DEVLOG.md` — This changelog
- `docs/AI-RULES.md` — 50 rules for documentation standards
- `docs/PLAN.md` — Pre-build assessment and gap analysis (19 identified gaps)
- `docs/templates/MODULE-TEMPLATE.md` — Boilerplate for feature module specs
- `docs/templates/ADR-TEMPLATE.md` — Boilerplate for architecture decision records

**Directories created:**
- `docs/ADRs/` — Architecture Decision Records
- `docs/modules/` — Feature module specifications
- `docs/runbooks/` — Operational runbooks
- `docs/templates/` — Document boilerplates

**Source documents inventoried:**
- `S1` — Phase 1 Expert Review (48KB docx, 118 issues) — reference input
- `S2` — Phase 2 Architecture Blueprint (49KB docx) — reference input
- `S3` — Principal Architect's Pre-Plan (86KB md, 1813 lines) — active reference

**Assessment completed:**
- 19 documentation gaps identified across 4 severity tiers
- 6 architectural corrections flagged in existing S3 document
- Dependency graph mapped: D01 (Schema) is the critical path blocker
- Recommended production order: Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3

**Architecture concerns logged (to resolve in D01/D04):**
1. Prisma vs Supabase client — pick one ORM strategy
2. Next.js version — lock 15 or 16
3. Middleware file naming — `proxy.ts` vs `middleware.ts`
4. Missing `deleted_at` on applications table
5. `current_user_org_id()` multi-org sync with JWT hook
6. IVFFlat index on empty table — consider HNSW or deferred creation

**Next steps:**
- Begin D01 (Complete Database Schema) — highest priority, unblocks 12 other documents
- Begin D04 (ADRs) — can run in parallel with D01
- Begin D05 (Design System) — independent, can run in parallel
